# String is the simplest thing

Code in this repo helps to answer following question:
Given three strings in UTF-8, which string length will you get in different languages?

Strings are read with the most common way language provides and length is computed respectively. If language provides more higher-level concept of length (number of code points, number of grapheme clusters), this concept is used.
